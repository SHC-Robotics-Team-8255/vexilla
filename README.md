#Vexilla#

You need to install things:

     make tools
     make repos

Then you can do work:

     cd repos

You will find a working example simple square bot program in
example-vexilla.  All you need to do to create your own code is
created a directory, copy the example code into it and edit.  You will
want to create your own git repo to store you code.  You can go into
that folder and push your code to the git repo you configure.
